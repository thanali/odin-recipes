    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish whose components can vary but usually include some combination of vegetables, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, salt, and fish sauce. The mix is pickled and fermented, which was originally a way to preserve the vegetables for the winter months. Cabbage is the most common vegetable used to make kimchi although carrots, radish, cucumber, and scallions are also frequently used, too. There are hundreds of kimchi recipes that vary depending on the region and season in which they are produced, and it's very easy to make it a vegan dish by keeping all the ingredients plant-based.</p>
    <p>Kimchi is available commercially and isn't expensive, but it can be fun to put together your own based on preferences. It can take a little bit of time to prepare the vegetables, but like other fermented foods (e.g., bread, beer, and kombucha), it's mostly a hands-off experience. It will develop its flavors and its nutritional profile during that process. Kimchi keeps for a while, making it an economical, versatile, and easy-to-prepare food item to have in the fridge.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
             <li>3 heads napa cabbage, cored and cut into quarters lengthwise</li>
             <li>½ cup salt</li>
            <li>3 heads garlic, minced</li>
              <li>1 bunch green onions, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
             <li>1 ½ tablespoons monosodium glutamate (MSG)</li>
             <li>2 teaspoons red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
         </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the cabbage leaves into 2 inch long pieces. Spread 1/4 of the leaves into a large, non-metallic bowl and sprinkle with 1/4 of the salt. Repeat layering all of the cabbage has been salted. Let stand at room temperature until a lot of liquid has been pulled from the leaves and the cabbage is tender, 3 to 4 hours; drain. Rinse the cabbage in 2 or 3 changes of water. Drain again very well and return the cabbage to the mixing bowl.</li>

        <li>Sprinkle the cabbage with the minced garlic, green onions, MSG, and red pepper flakes. Season to taste with additional salt and toss until evenly combined. Pack the mixture into a sterilized gallon-sized glass jar. Cover the jar with wax paper and a loose fitting lid so the seal is not airtight.</li>

        <li>Allow the cabbage to ferment at room temperature until it reaches the desired degree of sourness, 2 to 5 days. Store in an airtight jar in the refrigerator.</li>
