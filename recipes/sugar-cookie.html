    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Whenever you make these cookies for someone, be sure to bring along several copies of the recipe! You will be asked for it, I promise! NOTE: I make icing with confectioners' sugar and milk. I make it fairly thin, as I 'paint' the icing on the cookies with a pastry brush. Thin enough to spread easily but not so thin that it just makes your cookies wet and runs off.</p>

    <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Â½ cups butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cream together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Stir in flour, baking powder, and salt. Cover, and chill dough for at least 1 hour (or overnight).</li>

        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Roll out dough to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut into shapes with any cookie cutter. Place cookies 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Carefully transfer cookies to a wire rack and cool completely before decorating.</li>
    </ol>
